## Understanding GBDT through QnA

This is WIP - I have just thrown in some personal notes prepared based on my readings, searches and ChatGPT interactions. I have to add context in most places to make them intelligible.

#### Mental model of ‚ÄúGradient descent in function space‚Äù

###### *Is it OK to view gradient boosted decision trees as trained using the gradient between the outputs of successive weak learners instead of the gradient between successive batches?*

There is a slight misconception there \- ‚Äúgradient between successive batches‚Äù is a concept that exists in training NNs and that assumption leaks into this question\!

Yes, it's actually more accurate to view **gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs)** as being trained using **gradients between the outputs of successive weak learners**, rather than gradients between batches.

Let me unpack that a bit.

### üöÄ Gradient Boosting: The Core Idea

At each boosting iteration $m$, you're trying to **minimize a loss function** $L(y, F_m(x))$, where:

* $y$ is the true label,  
* $F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \eta h_m(x)$ is the prediction after adding the $m$-th weak learner $h_m$ scaled by learning rate $\eta$.

---

### üß† What‚Äôs the Gradient?

In GBDT, we define the "pseudo-residuals" as:

$r_{im} = - \left[ \frac{\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\partial F(x_i)} \right]{F(x) = F_{m-1}(x)}$

That is, we're computing the **negative gradient of the loss w.r.t. the model's output**, evaluated at the current ensemble prediction $F_{m-1}(x)$.

Then the next weak learner $h_m(x)$ is trained to **fit these residuals**.

---

### ‚úÖ So yes ‚Äî that interpretation is spot-on

You **can think of GBDT** as performing gradient descent **not on the weights of a single model**, but **in function space**: each new weak learner is essentially a small step in the negative gradient direction ‚Äî i.e., a corrective tweak to the ensemble's predictions.

There‚Äôs no notion of ‚Äúbatch‚Äù here like in neural networks. Instead, **the gradient is with respect to the current prediction function**, not the data batch ‚Äî even if you train on the full data in each step.

---

### üß© Summary Analogy

| Concept | Neural Nets | GBDT |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Parameters | Weights | Ensemble of trees |
| Gradient step | Update weights using gradient of loss | Add a new tree that approximates the gradient of the loss |
| Batch use | Gradients over mini-batches | Whole dataset typically used for each tree |
| Gradient | With respect to weights | With respect to model output function |

2 cool ways to deepen this understanding:

* mapped to a mathematical optimization framework
* visualized like gradient descent in function space - this is what I'll focus on as it's peculiar to GBDTs

###### *Visualized like grad desc in function space*

Alright, let‚Äôs paint that mental picture of **gradient descent in function space** ‚Äî it's a really elegant way to understand what's going on in gradient boosting.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Setup: What is "function space"?

Instead of optimizing over a vector of weights like in neural nets, gradient boosting optimizes over **functions** ‚Äî the functions mapping input $x$ to predictions $F(x)$.

So instead of:

$ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \nabla_\theta L(\theta) $

we do:

$$ F_{t+1}(x) = F_t(x) - \eta \cdot \nabla_{F} L(y, F_t(x)) $$

Here, $\nabla_{F} L$ is the gradient of the loss with respect to the output of the model ‚Äî a function!

---

### üìà Imagine this visually

Think of each function $F_t(x)$ as a **point in a huge, infinite-dimensional function space**. The landscape is shaped by your loss function ‚Äî hills and valleys depending on how good your predictions are.

At each iteration:

1. You evaluate the gradient of the loss at $F_t(x)$.  
2. That gives you a **direction in function space** ‚Äî the direction in which the loss decreases fastest.  
3. You move a bit in that direction by adding a weak learner $h_t(x)$ that tries to match the negative gradient.  
4. Now you're at a new point in function space: $F_{t+1}(x) = F_t(x) + \eta h_t(x)$

---

### üìâ Gradient Descent in Function Space ‚Äì a Visualization Analogy

Imagine you're playing a video game like **Hades**, and you're trying to get to the bottom level (lowest loss). You‚Äôre allowed to place one tile (a tree) per turn that moves you a bit closer to the goal.

* Each tile you place (tree) pushes your position closer to the target.  
* But each tile is **not perfect** ‚Äî it's constrained (e.g., a depth-3 tree can only represent certain shapes), so it can only approximate the ideal step direction.  
* Over many steps, you form a staircase of approximate steps, always heading downhill.

That‚Äôs gradient descent in function space: each weak learner is a little corrective move toward better predictions.

---

### üß† Real Intuition Bomb

At each step, you're **not trying to build a perfect model** ‚Äî you‚Äôre just trying to **nudge the overall ensemble** in the right direction by a small, approximated step ‚Äî a shallow tree that mimics the gradient.

And over time, these nudges accumulate to a strong predictive model.

###### *OK then. Correction to my original mental model: I'll view gradient boosted decision trees as training the current weak learners using the gradient of loss computed on the outputs of previous weak learners from the true label*

Yes\! That's the **corrected and clean** way to think about it. Let's write that down in your words, tuned just a bit for clarity:

"**In gradient boosted decision trees, each weak learner is trained using the gradient of the loss with respect to the model output ‚Äî where that output is the prediction made by the current ensemble of previous learners ‚Äî compared against the true label.**"

That way, you correctly frame it as:

* Gradient **from the loss function**,  
* Evaluated **at the ensemble's current predictions**,  
* **W.r.t. the function output**, not weights or batches,  
* And then used to train the **next weak learner**, which fits this gradient (or negative gradient) as a regression target.

---

So your updated mental model is now aligned with how gradient boosting is described in:

* **Friedman‚Äôs original paper** ("Greedy Function Approximation")  
* Implementations like **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost**  
* And even extensions like **Gradient Boosted Machines (GBMs)** or **Functional Gradient Descent**

You nailed it.

###### *In training NN vs GBDT, is it fair to think of NN training as updating parameters of the model function and GBDT training as updating the model function itself by adding another term?*

Yes ‚Äî that's a **very fair and insightful way** to frame the difference. Here's a precise breakdown of your mental model:

---

### üß† Neural Network (NN) Training

* **Model**: $f(x; \theta)$  

* **Training**: You **update the parameters** $\theta$ of a **fixed architecture** (e.g., layers, activations).  

* **Each gradient step** tweaks the internal weights:  

  $$ \theta\_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \cdot \nabla_\theta L(f(x; \theta), y) $$  

* The **model function $$f(x; \theta)$$** stays the same; its parameters get adjusted.

‚úÖ Mental model: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm sculpting one function more precisely by tuning its knobs.‚Äù*

---

### üå≤ GBDT Training

* **Model**: An ensemble $F(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M \eta h_m(x)$  

* **Training**: You **don‚Äôt change existing trees**. You **add a new function (tree)** at each step that corrects the current model.  

* You‚Äôre updating the overall function $$F(x)$$ itself:  

  $ F_{m}(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \eta h_m(x) $  

* Each $h_m(x)$ is trained to fit the **gradient of the loss** w.r.t. $F_{m-1}(x)$.

‚úÖ Mental model: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm building a better function by stacking small corrective patches.‚Äù*

---

### üß† Summary: Great Framing

| Aspect | Neural Networks | GBDT |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| What is updated? | Parameters $\theta$ of one model | The function itself via new learners |
| Gradient w.r.t. | Parameters $\theta$ | Model output $F(x)$ |
| Training result | One complex model with tuned weights | An additive ensemble of trees |
| Analogy | Fine-tune a sculpture | Add new pieces to a structure |

---

So yes ‚Äî your phrasing is accurate and actually aligns with the **functional gradient descent view** of boosting. It‚Äôs a powerful way to contrast parametric learning (NNs) with nonparametric ensemble methods (GBDTs).

## AdaBoost vs. GBDT

Qn: What is the difference between AdaBoost and GBDT?

Great ‚Äî let's break down the difference between **AdaBoost** and **GBDT** in how they **update models**, **compute weights**, and **optimize loss**. These two methods both build **boosted decision tree ensembles**, but their underlying logic is quite different.

---

## ü•ä AdaBoost vs GBDT: Side-by-Side

| Feature | AdaBoost | GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Loss function** | Exponential loss: $L = \sum \exp(-y*f(x))$ | Any differentiable loss: e.g. squared error, logistic, NDCG, etc. |
| **Data weighting** | Reweights training examples after each iteration | Uses residuals (gradients) as regression targets ‚Äî no sample reweighting |
| **Model update** | Adds new tree weighted by confidence (based on accuracy) | Adds new tree trained to fit the negative gradient of the loss |
| **Output type** | Classification (typically binary, 0/1 or \-1/+1) | Classification or regression (flexible) |
| **How it handles mistakes** | Increases weight on misclassified examples | Makes residuals (gradients) larger for bad predictions |
| **Final prediction** | Weighted sum of weak learners‚Äô predictions | Additive model: $F(x) = \sum_m h_m(x)$ |
| **Interpretation** | Repeatedly focuses on "hard" examples | Follows gradient descent in function space |

---

## üß™ 1. AdaBoost ‚Äì What Happens?

* Initialize all examples with equal weights.  

* At each iteration:  

  1. Train a weak learner $h_t(x)$ to minimize **weighted error**.  
  2. Compute the error rate $\epsilon_t$.  
  3. Compute learner weight $\alpha_t = \log((1 - \epsilon_t)/\epsilon_t)$.  
  4. Increase weights on misclassified samples.  
  5. Final model: $F(x) = \sum_t \alpha_t h_t(x)$

‚û°Ô∏è AdaBoost focuses more and more on hard-to-classify samples.

---

## üåä 2. GBDT ‚Äì What Happens?

* Choose a differentiable loss (e.g., squared loss, log loss).  

* Initialize $F_0(x)$ to a constant (e.g., mean label).  

* For each iteration $t$:  

  1. Compute pseudo-residuals:  

     $ r_{i}^{(t)} = - \frac{\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\partial F(x_i)} $  

  2. Train a tree to predict $r_i^{(t)}$ (a regression problem).  

  3. Update the model:  

     $ F_t(x) = F_{t-1}(x) + \eta h_t(x) $

‚û°Ô∏è GBDT minimizes the loss function via **gradient descent in function space**.

---

## üéØ Key Conceptual Difference

* **AdaBoost**: Adjusts **data weights** to emphasize mistakes.  
* **GBDT**: Adjusts **model output** to descend the gradient of the loss.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Example (Binary Classification)

| Aspect | AdaBoost | GBDT |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Data: 10 samples | Initially equal weights | No weights; compute residuals |
| Misclassified samples | Weight increased | Residual is large (steeper gradient) |
| Next tree | Focuses on misclassified points | Tries to fit those high-residual points |
| Overall model | Weighted vote | Additive model output, suitable for soft probabilities |

#### Boosted decision trees vs. GBDT

Qn: What is the difference between boosted decision trees and GBDT?
Misconception in the question: boosted decision trees is a class of algorithms, not a specific one. But still, the answer is instructive.

The terms **"boosted decision trees"** and **"GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees)"** are often used interchangeably, but there's a subtle difference in **generality** and **specificity**:

---

### ‚úÖ **Boosted Decision Trees** (General term)

* A **broad family** of models that combine many decision trees using the technique of **boosting**.  

* Boosting: sequentially adding models that correct the errors of previous ones.  

* The **loss function and optimization method** can vary:  

  * Could use **AdaBoost** (exponential loss),  
  * Or **LogitBoost**, **GentleBoost**, etc.  
  * Gradient-based or not.

So, ‚Äúboosted decision trees‚Äù just means *any ensemble of trees trained via a boosting algorithm*.

---

### üî• **GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees)** (Specific method)

* A **specific type** of boosted decision trees.  

* Introduced by Friedman (2001) as ‚ÄúGradient Boosting Machines‚Äù.  

* Core idea:  

  * At each iteration, fit a tree to the **negative gradient** of a chosen loss function (e.g. squared error, log loss, etc.).  
  * The loss is differentiable.

* Most modern libraries (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) implement some version of GBDT.

---

### üß† Summary Table

| Feature | Boosted Decision Trees | GBDT |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Is it a specific algorithm? | No | Yes |
| Type of loss? | Can vary (exponential, logistic, etc.) | Differentiable loss, optimized via gradients |
| Optimization method? | May not use gradients | Always uses gradients of loss function |
| Examples | AdaBoost, LogitBoost | XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost |

---

### üéØ Final Note

* All GBDTs are boosted decision trees.  
* But not all boosted decision trees are GBDTs.

#### RankNet on GBDT vs. LambdaMART

Qn: What is the difference between RankNet on boosted decision trees and LambdaMART?

Great question ‚Äî RankNet and LambdaMART are both **learning-to-rank algorithms**, but they differ in **how they model ranking loss** and **how they train boosted trees**. Let‚Äôs break it down cleanly:

---

### üß† **1\. RankNet (on GBDT)**

* **Origin**: Proposed by Microsoft Research (Burges et al.)  

* **Core idea**: Learn pairwise preferences using a **neural network** (but can also be adapted to GBDT).  

* **Loss**: Uses a **pairwise logistic loss**:  

  $$ L = \sum_{(i,j)} \log(1 + e^{-\sigma (s_i - s_j)}) $$  

  where $s_i, s_j$ are scores for documents $i$ and $j$, and the pair $(i, j)$ is such that $i$ should be ranked higher than $j$.  

* **When used with GBDT**:  

  * You minimize this **pairwise loss** using gradient boosting.  
  * At each iteration, gradients are computed wrt the RankNet loss, and a tree is trained to fit them.

---

### ‚ö° **2. LambdaMART**

* **Origin**: MART + LambdaRank ideas.  

* **MART** = Multiple Additive Regression Trees (a fancy name for GBDT).  

* **LambdaRank** = An extension of RankNet that injects **gradient magnitude based on change in NDCG**.  

* **Key Insight**: Instead of directly minimizing RankNet loss, compute a **‚Äúlambda‚Äù gradient** for each pair $(i, j)$, where the magnitude of the gradient depends on how much a pair swap would change a ranking metric (like NDCG or MAP).  

* **Training**:  

  * Still uses GBDT.  
  * But at each iteration, gradients (lambdas) are crafted to **approximate the effect of the current model on ranking metrics**.

---

### ü•ä RankNet vs LambdaMART

| Aspect | RankNet on GBDT | LambdaMART |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Loss Function | Pairwise logistic loss | Pairwise gradient signals derived from ranking metric deltas |
| Objective | Learn to rank via pairwise preferences | Learn to optimize ranking metrics like NDCG directly (indirectly through gradients) |
| Gradient Signal | Fixed (from logistic loss) | Dynamic and metric-sensitive (depends on current NDCG changes) |
| Performance | Good | Often better, especially when optimizing for top-k ranking metrics |

---

### üéØ Bottom Line

**LambdaMART** is a **metric-aware refinement** of RankNet-on-trees ‚Äî it keeps the pairwise flavor but makes the gradient direction and magnitude smarter, more aligned with what we actually care about (e.g., NDCG@10).

If you're ranking items and care about user-facing metrics, LambdaMART tends to perform better.
